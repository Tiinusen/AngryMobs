# Angry Mobs

This is gonna be my attempt to re-make an old map I made like 15 years ago, don't look it up, it's bad.

However this time I'm gonna try to make an playable map with enough custom logic to make it somewhat original.

I will start by making base types and abstraction layers, then some map details and game mechanics.

And last but not least, make the abstraction layers as a shared library for anyone to import and use.
